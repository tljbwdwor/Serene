# Serene
School project to design a list-based program using Vue.js

The design is very simple, allowing the user to input tasks with a date.
Media queries are used to re-format the site for mobile, tablet and desktop depending upon the screen size.

Tasks the user adds are dynamically added to the list, which is presented via a Vue.js component template.
Tasks can be removed, or prioritised using the corresponding buttons. The program starts with an example list of 4 tasks.

Prioritisation change the colour of the task and switches a boolean variable used to sort the list.
The list can be sorted by order the tasks are added (id, default view), as well as by date or priority.

Run the project in your IDE (Webstorm or Visual Studio Code).
